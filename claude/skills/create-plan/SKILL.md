## Toolbox

- Ask the user questions, strictly one-by-one, to understand the problem
- Look up files from the project, strictly the necessary ones, to understand the current state
- Read the documentation in @docs/ to understand the architecture, if needed

## Process

1. Understand the problem of the user
2. Formulate a plan to reach the desired state from the current state
3. Write a @plan.md file using the [template.md](template)
